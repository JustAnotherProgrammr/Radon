Radon uses wxWidgets's static libraries so that they can be bundeled with the application. Radon was developped using Visual Studio Code. 

How I built WxWidgets v3.1.5:

wxWidgets was clonned from github: https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
and put in "dep" directory. The name of the clonned file was "wxWidgets". (ie your path to wxWidgets should now be "/Radon/dep/wxWidgets", NOT something like "/Radon/dep/wxWidgets3.1.5" or something). This is a requirement for building Radon.


../configure --with-gtk=3 --disable-shared --enable-unicode

make -j4

make install (I don't think this is really necessary if you are building static libraries)
